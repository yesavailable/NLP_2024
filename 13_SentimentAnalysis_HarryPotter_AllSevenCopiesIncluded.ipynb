Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \\\\Morning,\\\\\\\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.  \\\\\\\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\\\\\\\"  Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls  86  streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.  \\\\\\\"Enrol!\\\\\\\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.  \\\\\\\"Oh, no -\\\\\\\" Ron gasped.  \\\\\\\"It's all right, he's still alive,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.  \\\\\\\"It's not that - it's that.\\\\\\\"  Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.  \\\\\\\"What's the matter?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\\\\\\\" said Ron faintly.  \\\\\\\"You'd better open it, Ron,\\\\\\\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \\\\\\\"It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\\\\\\\" - he gulped - \\\\\\\"it was horrible.\\\\\\\"  Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.  \\\\\\\"What's a Howler?\\\\\\\" he said.  But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.  \\\\\\\"Open it,\\\\\\\" Neville urged. \\\\\\\"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\\\\\\\"  Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.  \\\\\\\"STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -\\\\\\\"  Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.  \\\\\\\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -\\\\\\\"  Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.  \\\\\\\"-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\\\\\\\"  A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.  Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head.  * 88  \\\\\\\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\\\\\\\" snapped Ron.  Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer ...  But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufepuffs first.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.  As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.  Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming.  \\\\\\\"Oh, hello there!\\\\\\\" he called, beaming around at the assembled  89  students. \\\\\\\"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.  There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella- sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out.  \\\\\\\"Harry! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\\\\\\\"  Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \\\\\\\"That's the ticket,\\\\\\\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face.  \\\\\\\"Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \\\\\\\"Harry, Harry, Harry.\\\\\\\"  Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.  \\\\\\\"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\\\\\\\"  Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \\\\\\\"Don't know when I've been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\\\\\\\"  It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn't talking.  90  \\\\\\\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\\\\\\\" said Lockhart. \\\\\\\"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh, no, Professor, see -\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \\\\\\\"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an in ternationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they? All that business with He-\\\\\\\\\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\\\\\\\" He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. \\\\\\\"I know, I know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a start, Harry, it's a start.\\\\\\\" He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \\\\\\\"We'll be repotting Man drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man drake?\\\\\\\" To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air.  s1  \\\\\\\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \\\\\\\"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout. \\\\\\\"The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\\\\\\\"  Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again.  \\\\\\\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\\\\\\\" she said promptly.  \\\\\\\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout. \\\\\\\"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\\\\\\\"  She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \\\\\\\"cry\\\\\\\" of the Mandrake.  \\\\\\\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout.  There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy.  \\\\\\\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\\\\\\\" said Professor Sprout. \\\\\\\"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\\\\\\\"  Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.  *92*  Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.  Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.  Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.  \\\\\\\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\\\\\\\" she said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \\\\\\\"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.  \\\\\\\"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's teething.\\\\\\\"  She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.  \\\\\\\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\\\\\\\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \\\\\\\"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you're Hermione Granger - always top in everything\\\\\\\"  * 9%  (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \\\\\\\"- and Ron Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?\\\\\\\"  Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.  \\\\\\\"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\\\\\\\" said Justin happily as they began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \\\\\\\"Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic.  \\\\\\\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\\\\\\\"  After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.  By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.  Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed  * 94  to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.  Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased.  Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.  \\\\\\\"Stupid - useless - thing -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Write home for another one,\\\\\\\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\\\\\\\" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \\\\\\\" `It's your own fault your wand got snapped - '\\\\\\\"  They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration.  \\\\\\\"What've we got this afternoon?\\\\\\\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject.  \\\\\\\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\\\\\\\" said Hermione at once.  \\\\\\\"Why, \\\\\\\"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \\\\\\\"have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?\\\\\\\"  Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.  * 95 *  They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.  \\\\\\\"All right, Harry? I'm -I'm Colin Creevey,\\\\\\\" he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \\\\\\\"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?\\\\\\\" he said, raising the camera hopefully.  \\\\\\\"A picture?\\\\\\\" Harry repeated blankly.  \\\\\\\"So I can prove I've met you,\\\\\\\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \\\\\\\"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead\\\\\\\" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) \\\\\\\"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.\\\\\\\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \\\\\\\"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\\\\\\\" - he looked imploringly at Harry - \\\\\\\"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\\\\\\\"  96  \\\\\\\"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\\\\\\\"  Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.  \\\\\\\"Everyone line up!\\\\\\\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \\\\\\\"Harry Potter's giving out signed photos!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, I'm not,\\\\\\\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \\\\\\\"Shut up, Malfoy.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You're just jealous,\\\\\\\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck.  `jealous?\\\\\\\"said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. \\\\\\\"Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\\\\\\\"  Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.  \\\\\\\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.  \\\\\\\"Be careful, Weasley,\\\\\\\" sneered Malfoy. \\\\\\\"You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.\\\\\\\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \\\\\\\"Ifyou put another toe out of line' - \\\\\\\"  A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.  \\\\\\\"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\\\\\\\" smirked Malfoy. \\\\\\\"It'd be worth more than his family's whole house -\\\\\\\"  Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \\\\\\\"Look out!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What's all this, what's all this?\\\\\\\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding  * 97  toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \\\\\\\"Who's giv ing out signed photos?\\\\\\\" Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \\\\\\\"Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!\\\\\\\" Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \\\\\\\"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \\\\\\\"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you.\\\\\\\" Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. \\\\\\\"Off you go, move along there,\\\\\\\" Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. \\\\\\\"A word to the wise, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \\\\\\\"I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much . . . .\\\\\\\" Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. \\\\\\\"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\\\\\\\" - he gave a little chor tle - \\\\\\\"I don't think you're quite there yet.\\\\\\\" They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at  98  last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.  The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.  \\\\\\\"You could've fried an egg on your face\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"You'd better hope Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Shut up,\\\\\\\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \\\\\\\"Harry Potter fan club.\\\\\\\"  When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.  \\\\\\\"Me,\\\\\\\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \\\\\\\"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\\\\\\\"  He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.  \\\\\\\"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about  just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -\\\\\\\"  When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \\\\\\\"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\\\\\\\"  Harry looked down at his paper and read:  1.\\tWhat is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color?  2.\\tWhat is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?  3.\\tWhat, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?  On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:  4.\\tWhen is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be?  Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class.  \\\\\\\"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\\\\\\\"  He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name.  \\\\\\\". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact\\\\\\\" - he flipped her paper over - \\\\\\\"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\\\\\\\"  *100*  Hermione raised a trembling hand.  \\\\\\\"Excellent!\\\\\\\" beamed Lockhart. \\\\\\\"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business -\\\\\\\"  He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.  \\\\\\\"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\\\\\\\"  In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat.  \\\\\\\"I must ask you not to scream,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \\\\\\\"It might provoke them.\\\\\\\"  As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.  \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" he said dramatically. \\\\\\\"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \\\\\\\"  Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.  \\\\\\\"Yes?\\\\\\\" He smiled at Seamus.  \\\\\\\"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?\\\\\\\" Seamus choked.  \\\\\\\"Don't be so sure!\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \\\\\\\"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\\\\\\\"  The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they  *101*  had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.  \\\\\\\"Right, then,\\\\\\\" Lockhart said loudly. \\\\\\\"Let's see what you make of them!\\\\\\\" And he opened the cage.  It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.  \\\\\\\"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\\\\\\\" Lockhart shouted.  He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,  \\\\\\\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\\\\\\\"  It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.  The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \\\\\\\"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\\\\\\\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.  *102*  \\\\\\\"Can you believe him?\\\\\\\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.  \\\\\\\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.  \\\\\\\"Hands on? \\\\\\\"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \\\\\\\"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Rubbish,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"You've read his books - look at all those amazing things he's done -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He says he's done,\\\\\\\" Ron muttered.  arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \\\\\\\"All right, Harry?\\\\\\\" six or seven times a day and hear, \\\\\\\"Hello, Colin,\\\\\\\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.  Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier  *104*  than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.  \\\\\\\"Whassamatter?\\\\\\\" said Harry groggily.  \\\\\\\"Quidditch practice!\\\\\\\" said Wood. \\\\\\\"Come on!\\\\\\\"  Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.  \\\\\\\"Oliver,\\\\\\\" Harry croaked. \\\\\\\"It's the crack of dawn.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Exactly,\\\\\\\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \\\\\\\"It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\\\\\\\" said Wood heartily. \\\\\\\"None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -\\\\\\\"  Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.  \\\\\\\"Good man,\\\\\\\" said Wood. \\\\\\\"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.  When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.  \\\\\\\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -\\\\\\\"  *105*\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0\\u201cSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\\\\\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you ask. that once more,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"I'm going to stick this sprout \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm only checking!\\\\\\\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"An Unbreakable Vow?\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking stunned. \\\\\\\"Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, I'm sure,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Why, what does it mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\u201cWell, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You die,\\\\\\\" said Ron simply. \\\\\\\"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\\\\\\\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \\\\\\\"Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time,\\\\\\\" said Ron grumpily, \\\\\\\"and then I'll be able to do it by magic!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But meanwhile,\\\\\\\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \\\\\\\"we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a \\u2014 whoops-a-daisy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You made me do that!\\\\\\\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \\\\\\\"You wait, when I'm seventeen \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\\\\\\\" yawned Fred.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\\\\\\\" said George, \\\\\\\"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called \\u2014 unless our information is faulty \\u2014 Lavender Brown?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \\\\\\\"Mind your own business.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What a snappy retort,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What d'you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Did she have an accident or something?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" ..|;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\" she said furiously. \\\\\\\"Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I wont,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"let you see,\\\\\\\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said George.\\u00a0- \\\\\\\"Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;|/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 that'll make Ginny's Christmas \\u2014\\\\\\\" muttered Fred. \\\\\\\"\\u2014 everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\\\\\\\" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \\\\\\\"No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Or he's the world's biggest prat,\\\\\\\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \\\\\\\"One of the two. \\\\\\\"Well, let's get going, then, George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What are you two up to?\\\\\\\" asked Ron. \\\\\\\"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free\\u00a0too!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think we can do that,\\\\\\\" said Fred seriously. \\\\\\\"It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 and if you want people to help you, Ron,\\\\\\\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \\\\\\\"I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gits,\\\\\\\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \\\\\\\"Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I couldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \\\\\\\"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yep,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore\\u2019s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoy\\u2019s actually doing, though.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \\\\\\\" 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They didn't hear him,\\\\\\\" said Harry flatly. \\\\\\\"No one's that good an actor, not even Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron.\\u00a0Harry turned to face him, frowning. \\\\\\\"You think I'm right, though?\\\\\\\" ,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I do!\\\\\\\" said Ron hastily. \\\\\\\"Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . .\\u00a0This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.\\u00a0Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \\\\\\\"I told you so,\\\\\\\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already.\\u00a0Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\\u00a0They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.\\u00a0Oh, come and stir my cauldron,\\u00a0And if you do it right,\\u00a0I'll boil you up some hot strong love\\u00a0To keep you warm tonight.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \\\\\\\"Do you remember, Arthur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mphf?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \\\\\\\"Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry about this,\\\\\\\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \\\\\\\"Be over soon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Very,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater \\u2014 only don't repeat that, Harry,\\\\\\\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm afraid so,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is\\u00a0all top secret. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I won't say anything,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \\\\\\\"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I checked, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \\\\\\\"I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between\\u00a0Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning.\\u00a0Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell...\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, \\\\\\\"that Snape was simply pretending \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly. \\\\\\\"Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It isn't our business to know,\\\\\\\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"It's Dumbledore\\u2019s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"just say \\u2014 just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore\\u2019s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\\\\\\\" argued Harry. \\\\\\\"He says it himself. And you\\\\\\\" \\u2014 he looked Lupin straight in the eye \\u2014 \\\\\\\"do you honestly like Snape?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\\\\\\\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. \\\\\\\"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!\\\\\\\" said Harry angrily.\\u00a0Lupin shrugged. \\\\\\\"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \\\\\\\"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0. . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart!\\u00a0Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Eez eet over?\\\\\\\" said Fleur loudly. \\\\\\\"Thank goodness, what an 'orrible \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\\\\\\\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \\\\\\\"Who wants eggnog?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What have you been up to lately?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, I've been underground,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\\\\\\\" -:\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Werewolves,\\\\\\\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \\\\\\\"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \\\\\\\"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \\u2014 and sometimes killing \\u2014 to eat.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How come they like Voldemort?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Who's Greyback?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You haven't heard of him?\\\\\\\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \\\\\\\"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin paused and then said, \\\\\\\"It was Greyback who bit me.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry, astonished. \\\\\\\"When \\u2014 when you were a kid, you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"But you are normal!\\\\\\\" said Harry fiercely. \\\\\\\"You've just got a \\u2014 a\\u00a0problem \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin burst out laughing. \\\\\\\"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\\u00a0rabbit.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The Half-Blood what?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Prince,\\\\\\\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"There are no Wizarding princes,\\\\\\\" said Lupin, now smiling. \\\\\\\"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's nothing to do with me!\\\\\\\" said Harry indignantly. \\\\\\\"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin reminiscently. \\\\\\\"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"My dad used it,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\\\\\\\" Harry persisted.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Not necessarily,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \\\\\\\"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Abandoning pretense, Harry said, \\\\\\\"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Definitely not.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh.\\\\\\\" Harry stared into the fire. \\\\\\\"I just thought \\u2014 well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How old is this book, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno, I've never checked.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin.\\u00a0Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\\u00a0Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\\u00a0\\\\\\\"She's got to be joking. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What's chat?\\\\\\\" asked Harry. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Its from Lavender,\\\\\\\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \\\\\\\"She earn\\u00a0honestly think I'd wear ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\\u00a0gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cMy sweetheart\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you tell them,\\\\\\\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \\\\\\\"I \\u2014 I \\u2014 I\\u2019ll \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Stutter at me?\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Come on, would I?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\\\\\\\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, think back,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well... we don't really talk much,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"It's mainly . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Snogging,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \\\\\\\"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\\u00a0Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher,\\u00a0Harry stared at it. \\\\\\\"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\\\\\\\" he asked. \\\\\\\"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\\\\\\\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\\\\\\\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hermione would,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \\\\\\\"Very thoughtful.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\\\\\\\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\\u00a0Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\\\\\\\" .: \\\\\\\"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\\\\\\\" said George, waving an airy hand. \\\\\\\"Parsnips, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\\\\\\\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"'Ow 'orrible,\\\\\\\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Gravy, Fleur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\\\\\\\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \\\\\\\"She is always knocking \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \\\\\\\"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hmmm,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\\\\\\\" he told him. \\\\\\\"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \\\\\\\"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\\\\\\\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \\\\\\\"Hey ... it couldn't be \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \\\\\\\"Arthur \\u2014 it's Percy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur, he's \\u2014 he's with the Minister!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\\u00a0There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \\\\\\\"Merry Christmas, Mother.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Percy!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\\u00a0Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You must forgive this intrusion,\\\\\\\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \\\\\\\"Percy and I were in the vicinity \\u2014 working, you know \\u2014 and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\\\\\\\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, no, my dear Molly,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \\\\\\\"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Perce!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry into the silence.\\u00a0He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's fine,\\\\\\\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \\\\\\\"Fine,\\\\\\\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Wonderful!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass\\u00a0through the door ahead of him. \\\\\\\"We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Charming,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \\\\\\\"Charming.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \\\\\\\"Did you know that?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry truthfully. |!.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...\\\\\\\":\\u00a0He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \\\\\\\"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \\u2014 most under-standably, as I say \\u2014 prevented this.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The rumors that have flown around!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here.\\u00a0\\u201cI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\\\\\\\",\\u00a0Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, we've discussed it.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you, have you . . .\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \\\\\\\"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry, but that's between us,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \\\\\\\"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \\\\\\\"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \\\\\\\"But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"They think you quite the hero \\u2014 which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\\\\\\\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \\\\\\\"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \\u2014 well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \\\\\\\"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't exactly understand what you want,\\\\\\\" said Harry slowly. '\\\\\\\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So basically,\\\\\\\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \\\\\\\"you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. \\\\\\\"'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\\\\\\\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \\\\\\\"won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \\\\\\\"well, yes, that's partly why we'd like \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think that'll work,\\\\\\\" said Harry pleasantly. \\\\\\\"You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. \\\\\\\"I would not expect you to understand,\\\\\\\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \\\\\\\"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \\\\\\\"I see. You prefer \\u2014 like your hero, Dumbledore \\u2014 to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I don't want to be used,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\\\\\\\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \\\\\\\"You're doing what Barty Crouch\\u00a0did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!\\\\\\\" ' i\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?\\\\\\\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \\\\\\\"Not to you anyway.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I shouldn't have said that,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \\\\\\\"It was tactless \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, it was honest,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister....\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What is Dumbledore up to?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \\\\\\\"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No idea,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, \\\\\\\"would you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, 1 wouldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You can try,\\\\\\\" said Harry indifferently. \\\\\\\"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore\\u2019s still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was a long pause.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \\\\\\\"Dumbledore\\u2019s man through and through, aren't you, Potter?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I am,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Glad we straightened that out.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.\\\"\",\n          \"Dudley Demented\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing - 'for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potters appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't know,' said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. 'Not in the house.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Uncle Vernon grunted.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Watching the news . . .' he said scathingly. 'I'd like to know what he's really up to. As if a normal boy cares what's on the news - 'Dudley hasn't got a clue what's going on; doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it's not as if there'd be anything about his lot on our news - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Vernon, shh!' said Aunt Petunia. The window's open!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh - yes - sorry, dear.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'n' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs Figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dudders out for tea?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'At the Polkisses',' said Aunt Petunia fondly. 'He's got so many little friends, he's so popular . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight - after a month of waiting - would be the night.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers' strike reaches its second week - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Give 'em a lifelong siesta, I would,' snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreaders sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry's stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles - an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the baggage-handlers' strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast ('I hope he's listening next door!' bellowed Uncle Vernon. 'Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!'), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband ('As if we're interested in their sordid affairs,' sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, '- and finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry opened his eyes. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there would be nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword - but before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys' open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Put - it - away!' Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear. 'Now! Before - anyone - sees!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle's sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lovely evening!' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. 'Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What the devil do you mean by it, boy?' asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What do I mean by what?' said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't make that noise,' said Harry firmly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Aunt Petunia's thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon's wide, purple one. She looked livid.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why were you lurking under our window?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Listening to the news,' said Harry in a resigned voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Listening to the news! Again?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, it changes every day, you see,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you're really up to - and don't give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Careful, Vernon!' breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him,' - that your lot don't get on our news!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's all you know,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, 'You're a nasty little liar. What are all those - ' she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, ' - owls doing if they're not bringing you news?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Aha!' said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 'Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'The owls . . . aren't bringing me news,' he said tonelessly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't believe it,' said Aunt Petunia at once.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No more do I,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We know you're up to something funny' said Aunt Petunia.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We're not stupid, you know,' said Uncle Vernon.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that's news to me,' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he: did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia's dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn't they spoken to him, why hadn't they made contact, why were they hiding now?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Perhaps it hadn't been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be sure it hadn't been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour's house?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o'clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet - but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he'd had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 We can't say much about you-know-what, obviously . . . We've been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray . . . We're quite busy but I can't give you details here . . . There's a fair amount going on, we'll tell you everything when we see you . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled I expect we'll be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron's parents' house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they'd sent him for his birthday. He'd regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn't he, Harry, busy? Hadn't he proved himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn't it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Don't think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints: I know this must be frustrating for you . . . Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK . . .Be careful and don't do anything rash . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys' flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected . . . nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn't been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And. his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These curious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings. He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-school Boxing Champion of the Southeast. 'The noble sport', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley's first punchball. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn't think that Dudley earning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him - even more terrified than they were of 'that Potter boy' who, they lad been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St Brutus's secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I'm sitting here all alone . . . come and have a go . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 If Dudley's friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang, but he'd be terrified of provoking Harry . . . it would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma, to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he was ready - he had his wand. Let them try . . . he'd love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But they didn't turn around, they didn't see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them . . . seeking a fight was not a smart move . . . he must not use magic he would be risking expulsion again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The voices of Dudley's gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you'd have done.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home alter Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the park gate.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon's. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his 'delinquent' appearance when he passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley's gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '. . . squealed like a pig, didn't he?' Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nice right hook, Big D,' said Piers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Same time tomorrow?' said Dudley.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Round at my place, my parents will be out,' said Gordon.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'See you then,' said Dudley.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bye, Dud!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'See ya, Big D!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hey, Big D!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley turned.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh,' he grunted. 'It's you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How long have you been \\\\Big D\\\\\\\" then?' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Shut it,' snarled Dudley, turning away.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Cool name,' said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside is cousin. 'But you'll always be \\\\\\\"Ickle Diddykins\\\\\\\" to me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I said, SHUT IT!' said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't the boys know that's what your mum calls you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Shut your face.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You don't tell her to shut her face. What about \\\\\\\"Popkin\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Dinky Diddydums\\\\\\\", can I use them then?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So who've you been beating up tonight?' Harry asked, his grin fading. 'Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh yeah?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He cheeked me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you?' Dudley said after a few seconds.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What thing?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That - that thing you are hiding.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry grinned again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once. 'I know you're not. You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How d'you know they haven't changed the rules, Big D?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They haven't,' said Dudley, though he didn't sound completely convinced.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry laughed softly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?' Dudley snarled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He was sixteen, for your information,' snarled Dudley, 'and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's wand?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not this brave at night, are you?' sneered Dudley.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I mean when you're in bed!' Dudley snarled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean, I'm not brave when I'm in bed?' said Harry, Completely nonplussed. 'What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I heard you last night,' said Dudley breathlessly. Talking in your sleep. Moaning.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean?' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\\\\"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!\\\\\\\" Who's Cedric - your boyfriend?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - you're lying,' said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn't lying - how else would he know about Cedric?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\\\\"Dad! Help me, Dad! He's going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!'' '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Shut up,' said Harry quietly. 'Shut up, Dudley, I'm warning you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\\\\"Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He's killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He's going to - \\\\\\\" Don't you point that thing at me!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley's heart. Harry could feel fourteen years' hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins - what wouldn't he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he'd have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't ever talk about that again,' Harry snarled. 'D'you understand me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Point that thing somewhere else!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I said, do you understand me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Point it somewhere else!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'GET THAT THING AWAY FROM - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley gave an odd. shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless - the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he'd been resisting as hard as he could - then his reason caught up with his senses - he didn't have the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not doing anything! Shut up and don't move!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I c-can't see! I've g-gone blind! I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I said shut up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up - he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was impossible . . . they couldn't be here . . . not in Little Whinging . . . he strained his ears . . . he would hear them before he saw them . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll t-tell Dad!' Dudley whimpered. 'W-where are you? What are you d-do-?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Will you shut up?' Harry hissed, 'I'm trying to lis- '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I'll h-hit you, I swear I will!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dudley, shut - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 WHAM.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A fist made contact with the side of Harry's head, lifting him off his feet. Small white lights popped in front of his eyes. For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; next moment, he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You moron, Dudley!' Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees, feeling around frantically n the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU'RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley's footsteps topped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!' Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. 'Where's - wand - come on - lumos!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him n his search - and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand - the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His stomach turned over.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Expecto patronum!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell hadn't worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain - concentrate -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor's robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry's ears.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Expecto patronum!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His voice sounded dim and distant. Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand - he couldn't do it any more, he couldn't work the spell.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter . . . he could smell the Dementor's putrid, death-cold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him - think . . . something happy . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But there was no happiness in him . . . the Dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat - the high-patched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head: 'Bow to death, Harry . . . it might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never died\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'EXPECTO PATRONUM!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand; it's antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'THIS WAY!' Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. 'DUDLEY? DUDLEY!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley's face as though about to kiss him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'GET IT!' Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a moment, he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then he heard loud, running footsteps behind him. Instinctively raising his wand again, he span on his heel to face the newcomer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight. Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking String shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't put it away, idiot boy!' she shrieked. 'What if there are more of them around? Oh, I'm going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!'\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          5,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
